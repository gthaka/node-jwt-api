# API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation for the Node JWT Server. This document provides information about the available endpoints and how to interact with them.

## Swagger UI

We have integrated Swagger UI into the project to provide a user-friendly and interactive way to explore and understand the API endpoints. Swagger UI generates documentation directly from the code, ensuring that the documentation stays up-to-date with the actual endpoints.

You can access the Swagger UI documentation by visiting the following URL in your web browser:

### Swagger UI URL: http://localhost:3004/api-docs

Swagger UI presents a detailed overview of each endpoint, including the available HTTP methods, request parameters, request bodies, and responses. This interactive documentation makes it easy to test the endpoints and understand their functionality.

Please note that Swagger UI requires the application to be running for the documentation to be accessible.

Feel free to explore the API using Swagger UI and reach out if you have any questions or feedback about the endpoints or their usage.
